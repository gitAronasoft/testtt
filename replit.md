# VideoHub - Video Management Platform

## Overview

VideoHub is a comprehensive video management platform that enables video content monetization, user management, and analytics tracking. The system provides distinct interfaces for three user roles: administrators (platform management), creators (content upload and monetization), and viewers (content consumption and purchases). The platform features a role-based authentication system, payment processing, video streaming capabilities, and comprehensive analytics.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Multi-Page Application (MPA)**: Traditional HTML pages with JavaScript modules for enhanced interactivity

- **Configuration-Based Deployment**: Flexible base path configuration for root domain or subfolder deployment

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-Based Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three distinct user roles with protected routes
- **Multi-Step Registration**: Email verification followed by password setup
