## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application utilizes a multi-page HTML architecture, with shared JavaScript modules for common functionality. Key decisions include using Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, Vanilla JavaScript for performance and simplicity, and a modular JavaScript structure (`auth.js`, `dashboard.js`, `main.js`). All external libraries are loaded via CDN.

### Authentication System
The platform features a secure authentication system with JWT authentication and role-based access (Creator vs Viewer). It includes password hashing, input validation, and proper error handling.

### Dashboard Architecture
The system provides dual dashboard experiences tailored to user roles:
- **Creator Dashboard:** Focuses on core metrics like total videos, video purchases, earnings, and recent activity, with comprehensive earnings and settings pages.
- **Viewer Dashboard:** Streamlined to focus on essential functionality: browsing videos, managing "My Library," wallet management, and account settings.

### Data Management
The system is built with a clean, normalized database schema supporting users, videos, purchases, wallets, ratings, and administrative functions. It uses a MySQL database for production environments and can be configured with SQLite for local development.

### User Experience Design
Prioritizes responsive design and intuitive navigation across all devices. UI/UX decisions include consistent navigation, card-based layouts, interactive charts, immediate form validation feedback, and a mobile-first approach with comprehensive responsive design. Modern UI enhancements like gradients, animations, glass morphism effects, and improved styling are implemented across all pages.

### Technical Implementation
The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The backend is implemented in PHP with RESTful API endpoints, connecting to a MySQL database using `mysqli`. The system employs a clear separation between client and server, focusing on efficient data exchange and secure API interactions.
