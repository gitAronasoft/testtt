Replaced complex, nested authentication logic with simple SimpleProfileManager class. Fixed JavaScript syntax errors, created unified profile API endpoints, and ensured seamless profile updates for admin, creator, and viewer roles. All profile pages now use consistent, maintainable code without complex session handling.
- **Codebase Optimization Complete (August 13, 2025)**: Comprehensive optimization of VideoHub application including: removed unused profile.js file, implemented page-specific API loading (admin loads users only on users.html, videos only on videos.html), optimized viewer panel to load dashboard data only on dashboard.html and purchases only on purchases.html, streamlined creator panel for page-specific data loading, removed redundant viewer.js from purchases page and replaced with lightweight inline script, eliminated all static placeholder content and hardcoded values, and ensured zero redundant API calls across all panels.
