## Files Removed During Cleanup

### JavaScript Files Removed:
1. **global-functions.js** (118 lines) - Removed duplicate functionality
   - viewUserDetailsPage() function replaced with inline code
   - watchVideo() function was duplicate of viewer.js functionality

   - Replaced with consolidated profile.js across all profile pages
   - Removed duplicate user data loading logic
   - Streamlined profile forms to use single profile manager

3. **change-password.js** (435 lines) - Merged with profile.js

4. **deployment-config.js** (35 lines) - Configuration consolidated
   - Base path configuration moved to config.js
   - Removed from all HTML file references
   - Simplified deployment configuration approach

## Current Optimized Structure

### Core JavaScript Files (14 remaining):
- **admin.js** (1721 lines) - Admin panel functionality
- **api.js** (453 lines) - Core API communication
- **auth-guard.js** (336 lines) - Route protection
- **auth-manager.js** (482 lines) - Authentication management

### Benefits Achieved:
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed 948 lines of duplicate/redundant code
2. **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for profile management
3. **Improved Performance**: Fewer HTTP requests for JavaScript files
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Consolidated configuration and functionality
5. **Easier Debugging**: Less code duplication means fewer places to fix issues

## Recommendations for Further Optimization:

### Potential Consolidations:
1. **auth-manager.js** - Consider simplifying (has 42 commented lines)
2. **global-state.js** - Could be merged into api.js if caching becomes simpler
3. **youtube-api.js** - Only used in creator/videos.html, could be loaded conditionally

### File Structure Optimization:
- All core functionality is now properly separated by responsibility
- Profile management is unified across all user roles
- Payment system is consolidated and working efficiently
- Configuration is centralized in config.js

## Database Status:
- **MySQL Database**: Working perfectly with 13 videos
- **Stripe Integration**: Fully functional with proper payment processing
- **User Management**: Complete with proper role-based access
- **Video Management**: Full CRUD operations available

## Final Status:
✅ Codebase optimized and streamlined
✅ All duplicate functionality removed
