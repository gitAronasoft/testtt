## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses a **multi-page HTML architecture** with shared JavaScript modules for common functionality. Each major user flow (authentication, creator dashboard, viewer dashboard) has dedicated HTML pages with corresponding JavaScript files for specialized functionality.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Bootstrap 5 Framework**: Chosen for responsive design and rapid UI development
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Used instead of heavy frameworks for better performance and simplicity
- **Modular JavaScript Structure**: Separate files for authentication (`auth.js`), dashboard functionality (`dashboard.js`), and global features (`main.js`)
- **CDN-Based Dependencies**: External libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Chart.js) loaded via CDN for faster initial development

### Authentication System
The platform implements a **client-side authentication simulation** for development purposes, with demo accounts for testing different user roles.

**Authentication Features:**
- Role-based access (Creator vs Viewer)
- Form validation with Bootstrap styling
- Password recovery functionality
- Session management simulation
- Remember me functionality

### Dashboard Architecture
The system provides **dual dashboard experiences** based on user roles:

**Creator Dashboard:**
- Video upload and management interface
- Analytics charts using Chart.js
- Earnings tracking and monetization metrics
- Content performance analytics

**Viewer Dashboard:**
- Video discovery and browsing (Browse Videos section)
- Personal library management (My Library section)
- Wallet and payment management (Wallet section)  
- Account settings and preferences (Settings section)

### Data Management
Currently implements **client-side data simulation** for development, designed to be easily replaceable with backend API calls.

**Data Structures:**
- User profiles with role-based permissions
- Video metadata and content management
- Transaction and earnings tracking
- View analytics and engagement metrics

### User Experience Design
The platform prioritizes **responsive design** and **intuitive navigation** across all device types.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Consistent navigation pattern across all pages
- Card-based layouts for content organization
- Interactive charts for data visualization
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework for responsive design and components
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript charting library for analytics visualization

### Development Tools
- **CDN Delivery**: All external libraries loaded via CDN for rapid prototyping
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No additional build tools or transpilation required

### Future Backend Integration Points
The frontend is structured to easily integrate with:
- RESTful API endpoints for user authentication
- File upload services for video content
- Payment processing systems for monetization
- Database systems for data persistence
- Video streaming and transcoding services

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Mobile browsers for responsive functionality
- Progressive enhancement for older browser fallbacks
